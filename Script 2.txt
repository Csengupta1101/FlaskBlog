Hello everyone and welcome to this video. Now that we have come this far in our lesson I'm quiet sure that we all have
VS Code and Python downloaded in our system, so I'll not go over in all these installation details anymore.

I have already created my special project folder for this website. I have opened up the folder inside of the VS code.
I guess you all know that what we will be doing next. Let's open up the terminal and install the required modules as i show you.
Now you must be wondering that why I'm not creating a virtual environment this time , that's because I'll be using the same
flask version for this site that i use for my regular work. But I strongly suggest that while you create the website , make sure it's within
a new virtual environment.

let's install flask in our terminal with pip install flask. as you can see i have already got the same installed. So I'll wait
by the time yours get done. Now lets create our python file named "app.py". We will import flask class from flask module 
in our app.

We will now assign the app name as before. Now lets create our famous hello world function inside the app and run the same with
debug mode as True. Port we can define as per our own.

everything we have done will be seen as the code shown on the screen.

from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def index():
    return('Hello world')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True,port = 5000)

Lets define couple of more landing pages for a better understanding. Let's open up another page called register 
as we will need a registration page in our website.

The added page code snippet will look like as you can see on the screen -

@app.route("/resgister")
def register():
    return('Registration Page')

Now let's run the app again. One more fun fact , in flask framework , you can simply save the app.py file and it'll run automatically.
our initial url was - http://127.0.0.1:5000/ , and as we added another page , the url will be - http://127.0.0.1:5000/resgister
and this will return 'Registration Page' as the page content.


Same way we will create a login page , the code snippet for the same will be as shown 

@app.route("/login")
def login():
    return('Login Page')

and the url for this landing page will be - http://127.0.0.1:5000/login

You all might be wondering that why I keep on reapeting the same process over and over again , but trust me guys 
the more you practise the better you will become in mastering this awesome framework.

The basics are done as of now so this will be the end of this video. We will continute with templating and html rendering
in our next session. Till then keep learning.
