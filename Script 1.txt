Hello everyone and welcome to this video. Today we will be starting our next project. This is an advanced project.
We will be creating a complete website using flask framework. 

The website will take user registration as an input in the registration
form. And once the registration is done the message will be shown as the user has been registered.

Now we will be redirected to the login page. This is a blogging website. Once we log in , we will see the name above in the
navigation bar with which we have logged in.

Now look at the screen as i show you. I'm entering the registration form section and now i am submitting all the necessary details
Now once the registration is done , I am redirected towards the login page. Now I am logging in and as you can see we have log out option
as well. As i told you that this is a blog website  we will have a blog adding option as well.

We can input blog title and content and submit the same. Once the blog is posetd , we can see the same in the home page as well.
We can edit and delete the blog as well as I'm showing you.

Finally we can log out as well from the home page as I'm doing right now. And once the log out is sucesful we can see
that the login option came back right in the top as where it was before.

This would be the end of this video. We are all set for creating our first flask website , till now we have only created 
flask apps , now this is the real deal. We will be creating an actual website. 

I will see you on the next lesson and till then keep learning.
