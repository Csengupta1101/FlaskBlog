Hello everyone and welcome to this video. So we have created our database model already with required fields in place.
It's time to add data into the model. Today we will just be doing that only.

So without any further delay let's begin.

In today's session we will be adding up datapoints from our python terminal itself. So let's open the terminal
and code it up with data.

The data model is created is under the method name User. So let's import the model first.
from app import User

Then of course to add data in database we need to import db 
from app import db

Now let's add data points. As you know the id is primary key and is auto incremental so we will be adding the rest datapoints.
We have username , first and last name , email id , password and city as required fields. so we will add all of them
altogether -

user = User(username = "csengupta"' , fname = "chandan" , lname = "sengupta" , email = "csengupta1101@outlook.com" 
, password = "abcd1234" , city = "kolk4" , city = "kolkata")

we are assigning the datapoints to user class here.

Now let's add the data to session and commit.
>>> db.session.add(user)
>>> db.session.commit()

now we can query on all the data points with SQL like commands -

>>> data = User.query.all()
>>> data

this will fetch us the user details as result.we can even fetch this data by index.
to access the first indexed item , here it's username we can simply pass on data[0].

We can also visit the sqlite viewer to see the data updated as we gave the input -

In this lesson we have learned how to add on the details in our data from python terminal itself.
In our next lessons we will look into how to add data through the form that we added on the registration page
