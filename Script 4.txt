Hello everyone and welcome to this video. Today we will be discussing that how we can inherit the content of main.html
file into other templates that we have in place. 

So without further delay , let's begin.

To begin template inheritence , we need to create blocks. the common contents for all the pages , as in designs, fonts etc
will kept out side of the block. And the unique content for each page , as login page content and registration page
content is going to be different , hence they will be kept inside of the box.

As an example , the title of each page is going to be different , hence the title segment will be kept inside of the box.
the code snippet -

    {% block title  %}
    <title>Main Page</title> 
    {% endblock title  %}

Same way the body content of each page is going to be different as well , hence will be kept inside of the block.
We'll call it body block.

    {% block body  %}
    <h1>Main Page</h1>      
    {% endblock body  %}

So we have implemented blocks for title and body content in the main.html files. This simply means that everything
else that's there in the main.html file will be inherited in other html files , like the bootstrap css structuring -

 <!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-1BmE4kWBq78iYhFldvKuhfTAU6auU8tT94WrHftjDbrCEXSU1oBoqyl2QvZ6jIW3" crossorigin="anonymous">

So we did get an fair idea on how blocks work. On the next session we will start working on individual html files.
This would be the end of this video and we will again meet on the next lesson.
