Hello everyone and welcome to this video. Today's session will be a small yet extremely crucial one. 
So I would request all of you to be extremely attentive here.

I hope most of you are in social media sites like , facebook , instagram etc. Now what exactly happens when you
first create a profile in these sites? you get a welcome message right ??

Today we will be in-corporating the same into our site using flask frame work. We will be taking help of both flask 
documentation and bootstrap files.

From the flask framework we will be importing flash module. The documentation of flashing will help us to access 
the coding part of the same. Inside of the flash codes we will code up the bootstrap segment which will display
the desired alert message.

We will be redirecting our users to the login page of the site. After the registration is done , we would require people to log in.
Hence the redirection will be pointed toward the login page.

The code snippet on the login page is as shown in the screen -

{% block body %}
<h1>Login Page</h1>
{% with messages = get_flashed_messages(with_categories=true) %}
  {% if messages %}
    <ul class=flashes>
    {% for category, message in messages %}
    <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
        <h4 class="alert-heading">Well done!</h4>
        <p>you've succefully registered.</p>
      </div>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>
  {% endif %}
{% endwith %}    
{% endblock body %}

The messages shown "you've succefully registered." is what will reflect in the system once the registration is processed.
The app.py file needs a secret key set up as well. The code snippet is as shown on the screen -

app = Flask(__name__)

app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///mydb.db'
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'thisissecret'
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

Now once you run the file and fill up the registration form , the alerts message will reflect and login page will be
redirected to.

This would be the end of this video. We will again meet on the next lesson. Till then keep learning.
