Hello everyone and welcome to this video. It's time for us to start working with other html files and fetch 
the required contents from other html files as well.

So without any further delay let's begin.

Let's move to the index.html page. Primarily we will extend the common elements from our main page into this file.
So let's extend the main file content into here with code as seen on the screen -

{% extends 'main.html' %}

Now for the unique contents , let's bring in the blocked contents and name them properly. As the index page will be 
first landing page hence we will call it home page. the code snippet is as show on the screen -

{% block title %}
<title>Home</title>   
{% endblock title %}

{% block body %}
<h1>Home Page</h1>    
{% endblock body %}

As you can see , we are covering both the title and the heading part of the home page. Now let's render the index.html
in our index method inside the app route of app.py , the code snippet will be as seen on the screen -

@app.route("/")
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

In the same manner we will render template for the other pages we have. Login and register page as well. code snippet
are as shown on the screen -

@app.route("/register")
def register():
    return render_template('register.html')

@app.route("/login")
def login():
    return render_template('login.html')

The html content in both login and registration page will be as shared in the screen -

{% extends 'main.html' %}

{% block title %}
<title>Login</title>   
{% endblock title %}

{% block body %}
<h1>Login Page</h1>    
{% endblock body %}

{% extends 'main.html' %}

{% block title %}
<title>Register</title>   
{% endblock title %}

{% block body %}
<h1>Registration Page</h1>    
{% endblock body %}


So now let's move ahead. We have created routes for all required templates and we rendered them as well.
This would be the end of this video and we will again meet on the next lesson. Till then keep learning.
