Hello everyone and welcome to this video. So we have succesfully created our login form and are able to login
through that. Great work guys.

So now our job is to show the right options in the login page , once a user has logged in. Once a user has logged in
, he or she must have access to logout option. And also creating a blog option , as our website is a blogging site.

So without any further delay let's begin.

So we know what to be done , let's code it up. 

Let's talk about home page first. We want to make sure that the home page displays the user name who has logged 
into the site. To ensure that our index.html snippet will be as shown on the screen -

{% block body %}
<h1>Home Page</h1>
{{current_user.username}}    
{% endblock body %}

Now let's work on the main.html page as all the other pages are rendered from there. Let us create function that will
display the logout and making a blog post option towards the user. And these options will be shown in the navbar.

  <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-dark bg-dark">

    <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">My Blogs</a>
    <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#navbarSupportedContent" aria-controls="navbarSupportedContent" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
      <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
    </button>
    <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarSupportedContent">
      <ul class="navbar-nav me-auto mb-2 mb-lg-0">
        <li class="nav-item">
          <a class="nav-link active" aria-current="page" href="#">Home</a>
        </li>
        {% if current_user.is_authenticated%}
        <li class="nav-item">
          <a class="nav-link" href="">{{current_user.username}}</a>
        </li>
        <li class="nav-item">
          <a class="nav-link" href="/blogpost">Post Blog</a>
        </li>
        <li class="nav-item">
          <a class="nav-link" href="/logout">Logout</a>
        </li>
        {% else %}
        <li class="nav-item">
          <a class="nav-link" href="/register">Register</a>
        </li>
        <li class="nav-item">
          <a class="nav-link" href="/login">Login</a>
        </li>
        {% endif %}
      </ul>

</nav>

Now if we run our app and log into the website with any of the user data that we have submitted , we will have the 
blog post and log out options in the navbar section.

Now we have succefully created the navbar options to be shown after a user login. But we are yet to create a landing 
page for these options. The log out and blog post options doesn't have any landing pages as of now.

On our next lesson we will focus on creating them.

So this would be the end of this video and we will again meet on the next lesson.
