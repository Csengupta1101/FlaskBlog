Hello everyone and welcome to this video.Today We will begin rendering templates now into our sites.

So without further delay let's begin.

Lets create our templates sub directory now and do remember to name it "templates". once that is done 
let's create 3 html pages inside the templates directory as we have created 3 landing pages as , index , login
and register. so our html pages will be names accordingly.

we will also create another html file called main.html. this will have the common codes to extend in other html files.
we will use template inheritence here.

Now it's time for bootstrap , lets go to getbootstrap.com.We will fetch the code from here to use in our main.html
file which will be our base file. Lets copy the starter template and paste it in main.html. Now let's have a look at 
how the template works. Right click on the main.html and open it with live server , you'll see a webpage returning 
"Hello World". This is our base template.

Let's also create a url landing for main.html in our app.py , the code snippet will be as

@app.route("/main")
def main():
    return('base file')

now for accessing the templates , let's import render template class , the code snippet for the same will be -
from flask import Flask , render_template

and now instead of simply returning a statement on the main.html file let's render the entire html page in -

@app.route("/main")
def main():
    return render_template('main.html')

And now when you access the url as - http://127.0.0.1:5000/main , you'll see the "Hello World" statement. We can also
change the title heading of main.html as "main page". That's more convinient , so let's do that inside the
main.html page code -

    <title>Main Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Main Page</h1>

So our pages are all set as of now. Let's end the session here , and on the next session we will discuss how we will be 
inheriting the main.html content into other html files.
