Hello everyone and welcome to this video. In today's lesson we will how to create a database model.This database model
will accept user inputs in the page and will store the data in the database server.

So without any further delay , let's begin.

Like before we will again resort to the sqlalchemy documentation. As you can see on the screen , there is pre defined 
User method stated in there. We will simply copy the code and paste it in our app.py , the code snippet will be as shown
on the screen -

class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)
    email = db.Column(db.String(120), unique=True, nullable=False)

    def __repr__(self):
        return '<User %r>' % self.username

In here as you can see , by default 3 input parameter is given. id is the primary key. It also is a default parameter 
for our data base. So we will leave it as it is. We'll create rest parameters as per our requirments. As seen in the screen -
class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)
    fname = db.Column(db.String(120),  nullable=False)
    lname = db.Column(db.String(120),  nullable=False)
    email = db.Column(db.String(120), unique=True, nullable=False)
    password = db.Column(db.String(120),  nullable=False)
    city = db.Column(db.String(120),  nullable=False)

As all the inputs will be strings , hence same is mentioned. first name , last name , password and city name can be same for multiple
user. Hence unique arguments are not assigned to them. 80,120 etc are length limit for each strings.
We have nullable as false , as we won't let any null value stay in our data.

 as the model is created , lets set the model in our database. Open up the python terminal.
 Type the code as shown on the screen and your database will be created in the folder.

>>> from app import db
>>> db.create_all()
>>> 

now let's check what data our database holds. As our data model is under User method , we'll fetch it -
>>> from app import User
>>> user=User.query.all()
>>> user
[]

As you can see our data model is returning a blank list , as we didn't give any input as of now. But our 
Data Model is created and is functional.

This would be the end of this video and we will again meet on the next lesson.
