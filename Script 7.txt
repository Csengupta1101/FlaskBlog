Hello everyone and welcome to this video. So we have completed creating our registration form. Now each time an user submits the data,
we need to store them.So we need the help of a database where these data will be stored.

So without any further delay let's begin.

As we learned in our last lesson , we need sqlalchemy for this. Let's install it at the terminal.I have in installed
so here it says requirement satisfied already. Once we have installed it from the terminal let's import the module
at the app.py file.

the code snippet for importing are as shown on the screen.

from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

One small thing to mention here. You might face difficulty while importing the module saying the module is not recognised.
Although you have just got sqlalchemy installed , this issue may arise. Don't get confused. In such scnario follow the steps
as i instruct. First check the version of python , you have in your system. For me it's 3.6.8. And now go to the "select
interpreter" section at the VS-Code. Ctrl+shift+p will open up the search box. From there you can select your interepreter
as the same version of your system. And the problem will be resolved.

Great , now the modules are imported. Let's go ahead and create the database now. As you can see on the screen I'm again 
reaching out for official documentation of SQLAlchemy for the codes. 

now we have to instantiate the SQLAlchemy module, and for that, we can both use SQLite of MySQL database. we will use SQLite here. 
Although from your end you can use MySql as well. To access the SQLite database URL, we need to go to 'SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'  in google search. Access the site and copy the SQLite URL from there.

Then use the copied code as below,

from flask import Flask, render_template
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = "sqlite:///mydb.db"

please note that the copied URL was - sqlite:////tmp/test.DB, and we have changed it to our requirement and will.

Now we will be taking note of two things before we run the app and create our database.
We will set SQLAlchemy Track  Modifications as False.
Now run the app. Code as you can see on the screen -

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = "sqlite:////mydb.db"
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

The moment we run this successfully, we are one step closer to create our database. 

Our data model is created. Let's create the database now. We need to use the python terminal for that.
Type the code as shown on the screen and your database will be created in the folder.

>>> from app import db
>>> db.create_all()
>>> 

Have a look at the folder explorer of your vs code. mydb.db is created.

This would be the end of this video and we will again meet on our next session. Till then keep learning.
